# Supply Chain Analysis Project

#### Executive Summary
The Supply Chain Analysis project focuses on optimizing the supply chain operations by analyzing product sales, revenue, manufacturing costs, and stockout events. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help the organization enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and maximize profits. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key metrics, such as most sold products, profits per unit sold, and sales per location.

#### Business Problem
Efficient supply chain management is critical for maintaining product availability, minimizing costs, and maximizing revenue. This project aims to address the following questions:
- What are the most sold products, and how do they contribute to overall revenue?
- How do manufacturing costs and stockout events impact profitability?
- What are the geographical trends in sales, and how can they inform distribution strategies?

1. **Data Collection**: Collected data on product sales, manufacturing costs, and stock levels from company databases.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Ensured data accuracy by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyzed key metrics related to product performance, profitability, and geographic sales distribution.
4. **Data Visualization**: Developed a dashboard to visualize the analysis and provide a clear understanding of supply chain performance.
